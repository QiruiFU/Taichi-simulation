## MPM for simulating snow and elastic body

The implementation is based on : *A Material Point Method For Snow Simulation (Alexey et al. 2013)* and [GAMES 201](https://yuanming.taichi.graphics/teaching/2020-games201/)

## Videos

Here are some simple videos. I just rendered the particles in Houdini, instead of rendering the snow effect based on volume.
